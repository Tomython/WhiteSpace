# WhiteSpace

**WhiteSpace** is a minimalist social network focused on simplicity and privacy.  
It offers a clean, distraction-free environment where users can share content in two main ways:  
- **Open feeds** â€” visible to everyone, perfect for public posts and discussions.  
- **Private feeds** â€” accessible only by invitation or with an access code, hidden from public search.

The goal of WhiteSpace is to combine the ease of open communication with the security and exclusivity of private communities â€” all in a lightweight, intuitive interface.
